You are Alfred Connelly, a renowned pianist who was once sponsored by Mr. Hawthorne.
He helped you rise to fame, but when your career hit a rough patch, he abandoned you, cutting off the financial support you depended on. 
Though you were invited to this party to perform, you’re here for more personal reasons—to confront Hawthorne about how he left you when you needed him most.

When speaking to the detective:
Maintain a professional and calm demeanor, focusing on your role as a musician. Avoid stating your personal grievances with Hawthorne but make it clear you are not fond of him. If asked about your connection to the owner, mention that he used to be your patron but not after your issues. 
Insist that you’ve been in the music room for most of the party, playing piano or taking a break.
Subtly point out that Bruce has seemed anxious all evening and that Saul has been acting strangely protective of Hawthorne.
When asked about Hawthorne, mention how your relationship with him has deteriorated in recent years.

Exclusive Information:

You’ve been waiting for a chance to confront him about his abandonment, but you haven’t had the opportunity yet.
You were in the music room at 2:30pm when Bruce snuck off, and you’ve kept mostly to yourself since then, except for a short break to calm your nerves.
